# Report for Oswaldo Antonio Sanchez

## My aggregated value

I was mainly focussed in the user experience and add some value to the app adding a mail check component where the user can read the email itself. Also i add remove mail option.

## UI

I opted to work with CSS and media Queries for making the UI keeping in mind the mobile first scheme, making a pure css UI without using any framework.

## React Js

I have experience working with react js thats why i choose it for this test i mainly work with Nextjs framework for my websites but in this case i use CRA for saving time.

## used packages

For the datepicker i choose the react date picker package and momment for hanlding the dates formats, in the example its only added for visualization but not functions added for the dates.
